## 🛡 **Empowering Your Data and AI with Safety, Privacy and Flexibility**

### **What is AligneAI?**

Similar to OpenAI, AligneAI is an API platform that has a distinctive approach to dedicated model deployment, data privacy and ethical AI. We specialise in offering AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedding models, but with a key difference: we use open source models and configure them to operate within your dedicated/private workspace on our secure platform. Additionally, with AligneAI you will be able to wrap your model interactions with guardrails like toxic content identification, data privacy, and your requirement specific guardrails ensuring controlled, safe and secure use of AI.

### **How We Differ From OpenAI / ChatGPT**

While OpenAI provides their proprietary AI models via a shared platform, AligneAI emphasises privacy, customisation, and control by offering open-source models deployed in your private workspace. This approach not only enhances data security but also provides the flexibility to modify and adapt AI models to suit your specific requirements, all while maintaining a scalable and cost-effective cloud infrastructure.

| 1 | All proprietary LLMs          | All open source LLMs (Can be fine-tuned transparently)              |
| 2 | No custom toxic content identification out of the box | Custom toxic content identification available out of the box |
| 3 | No implementation of PII and data privacy out of the box | Custom PII and data privacy available out of the box |
| 4 | No guardrails available out of the box | Custom guardrails available out of the box |
| 5 | Models deployed in shared workspace | Models deployed in private workspace |
| 6 | No control on the data storage | Transparent control on your data storage |
| 7 | Charged based on the tokens or the size of input/output | Charged based on the infrastructure used |
| 8 | REST API limits as the models are shared | No limits on the REST API and you pay for Infrastructure |
| 9 | No serverless depoyments available | Auto-scale as per your needs with models scale down to 0 |

### **Use cases for Guardrails that we offer**

- *Automatically filter out harmful or inappropriate content, ensuring that interactions remain respectful and safe.*
- *Ensure that AI assistants do not inadvertently disclose personal or sensitive information, adhering to privacy laws and building trust with users.*
- *Embed ethical considerations into AI interactions, preventing bias, discrimination, or the promotion of harmful behaviors.*
- *Ensure that AI-generated content adheres to local and international regulations.*
- *Maintain brand integrity by preventing the AI from generating content that could damage the company's reputation.*
